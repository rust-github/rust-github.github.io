# Introduction

Creating a new Rust project is as easy as typing `cargo new <project_name>`,
but often you need more than what `cargo new` gives you.

This is when [cargo generate](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate)
comes into play:

> cargo-generate is a developer tool to help you get up and running quickly
  with a new Rust project by leveraging a pre-existing git repository as a template.

[Rust GitHub Template](https://github.com/rust-github/template) (this project)
is a template for `cargo generate` that aims to be a starting point suitable for
the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.

Stop copy pasting tons of markdown and yaml files each time you start a new
rust project. Let's write them only once, together!

You can see an example of this template [here](https://github.com/rust-github/rust-gh-example).

## Template content

### GitHub Actions

* [security checks](https://github.com/rust-github/template/blob/master/.github/workflows/audit.yml)
* [continuous integration](https://github.com/rust-github/template/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml) -
  on pull request or push:
  * tests
  * rustfmt
  * clippy
  * code coverage update
* [continuous delivery](https://github.com/rust-github/template/blob/master/.github/workflows/cd.yml) -
  on every git tag in the `[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` format (for example `0.2.14`):
  * publish release for mac, linux and windows
  * publish to cargo

## Instructions

### Project creation

{% raw  %}

* Install `cargo generate` (version >= 6.0).

  ```sh
  cargo install cargo-generate
  ```

* create your project with this template.

  ```sh
  cargo generate --git https://github.com/rust-github/template.git
  ```

* `cd` into your project.

* this is just a template, so edit your project according to your own needs by
  adding what's necessary and removing what you don't like.

* create a [new](https://github.com/new) empty repository (do not initialize it
  with a README, a `.gitignore` or a license).

* follow GitHub instruction to "push an existing repository from the command line".

{% endraw %}

### Crates.io

Set up your crates.io token in a
[GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)
called `CARGO_API_KEY`.

For more info about the crates.io tokens, see
[The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html).

### Code coverage

* [sign up](https://coveralls.io/sign-up) to coveralls.
* [add](https://coveralls.io/repos/new) your repo.

### Publish

When you are ready to publish the first version of your application, run:

```sh
git tag -a 0.1.0
git push --follow-tags
```

This tag should trigger the continuous deployment, that will:

* publish your application on crates.io
* publish the binaries on GitHub Releases

## Supporting Rust Github Template

The best way to support the project is to contribute to it by reporting
problems, ideas or sending pull requests.

If you created your project by using Rust GitHub Template, and you want to show
it, you can use our badge:

* For Markdown:

  ```markdown
  [![Rust GitHub Template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust%20GitHub-Template-blue)](https://rust-github.github.io/)
  ```

* For HTML:

  ```html
  <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/"><img alt="Rust GitHub Template" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust%20GitHub-Template-blue" /></a>
  ```
